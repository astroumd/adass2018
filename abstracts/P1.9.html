<b>Title:</b> <i>Putting more intelligence into the reduction and analysis of SITELLE data.</i>
<br><br>
SITELLE is the imaging Fourier transform spectrometer of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). It delivers cubes of 4 million spectra at moderate resolution (R~3000 - 10000) on a 11'x11' FOV with a spatial resolution of 0.32. 

Each data cube contains up to 34 Go of data and a handful of different astrophysical objects which cannot all be detected easily (especially at low signal-to-noise ratio) : high-redshift galaxies, planetary nebulae, emission-line stars, compact hii regions, etc. Object detection and classification is a challenge. We have developed tools based on convolutional neural networks that greatly help reasearcher to quickly find the most hidden objects.

Data reduction have also been enhanced with deep neural networks for cosmic ray detection and stars detection.

Finally, spectral model fitting can also take advantage of the python library Tensor Flow which provides GPU optimized minimization algorithm.

We will also see more of the marvelous data obtained recently.
