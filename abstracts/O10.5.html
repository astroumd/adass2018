<i>Bringing together the Australian sky - coordination and interoperability challenges of the All-Sky Virtual Observatory</i>
<br><br>
The Australian All-Sky Virtual Observatory (ASVO) consists currently of 5 nodes. There are 2 nodes with optical astronomical data; Data Central (MQ) and Skymapper (ANU). There are 2 nodes with radio data; Murchison Wide Field Array (MWA, Curtin) and CSIRO ASKAP Science Data Archive (CASDA, CSIRO). The last node is the Theoretical Astrophysical Observatory (TAO, Swin). These 5 nodes work together under the unified ASVO. 

The Australian astronomical user community is driving multi-node and multi-wavelength use cases, for example, querying Data Central spectroscopic data with Skymapper imaging data. Meeting the user requirements of the community comes with complexities and challenges. Some of the challenges we are facing include a single sign-on (unified authorisation/authentication) and the querying and representation of very different remote data, such as, overlaying GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA Survey (GLEAM) data stored in Western Australia with imaging data stored in Eastern Australian states. This presentation will discuss the challenges and successes in both co-ordinating the Australian ASVO and providing interoperability across the 5 nodes.
