<b>Title:</b> <i>New visualization Features in Firefly</i>
<br><br>
Firefly is IPAC's Advanced Astronomy WEB UI Framework. It was  open sourced in 2015, hosted at GitHub. Firefly is designed for building a web-based front end to access science archives  with data visualization capabilities. Firefly provides integrated interactive data visualization capabilities with images, catalogs, and plots.  It has been used in many IPAC IRSA applications, in LSST Science Platform Portal, and in NEDâ€™s newly released interface.

The team has been working on adding new features to Firefly visualization for last year. The most recent addition is HiPS image display, released to public in IRSA Viewer. This talk gives an overview of Firefly's new HiPS support and how we make the smooth transition between HiPS and FITS image displays.
