<i>Pixel mask Filtering of CXC Datamodel</i>
<br><br>
We present pixel mask filtering algorithm, a new attribute to Datamodel library. Datamodel, a Chandra X-Ray Center data analysis software (CIAO) package, facilitates a wide range of on-the-fly data manipulation capabilities such as copy, differ, binning and filtering. The pixel mask filtering of a 2-D binary image is integrated into the CIAO region filtering syntax and logic, and thus complements the 
conventional analytic shapes filtering of circle, rectangle, polynomial. The integration allows for the standard operations on combining masks and analytic shapes such as include, exclude, intersect, and union. The mask is stored in a data block, 
referenced by the region filter string in the resulting file's data subspace.
We will highlight the features and usage of pixel mask filtering in
the CIAO software, and discuss some divergent effects between mask filtering and region shape filtering.
