<i>WAN OPTIMIZATION FOR ALMA DATA</i>
<br><br>
Proof of Concept
 
In the era of large observatories and huge data transmission through the networks, we did a proof of concept using Riverbed technology to address the ALMA data distribution challenge: limited bandwidth, far away locations and large amounts of data.  In the ALMA case from the Atacama desert in Chile to our regional centers in the northern hemisphere.  The PoC shows the percentage of reduction in network traffic, after applying de-duplication, tcp window optimization and virtual latency improvement on scienctific data.
