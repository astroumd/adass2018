<i>Realtime telescope and data visualization using web technologies</i>
<br><br>
When performing onsite or remote observations in a telescope, it is very critical to have a good feedback about the current status of your ongoing observation. Nowadays the web technology have evolved to allow us to get data in realtime with the advantage of using just a web browser.

In our telescope we found the need of updating our previous outdated monitoring system which is currently showing information about the status of the telescope, the last scans plots, a view of the current weather conditions, etc

This poster shows how the data visualization has improved by using newer technologies like microservices, websockets and messaging, as well as the structure developed to integrate them succesfully in a reliable and more attractive way.
