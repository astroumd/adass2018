<i>GDL - GNU Data Language 1.0</i>
<br><br>
On behalf of the GDL team, we will be glad to use the occasion of ADASS 
2018 to announce the 1.0 release of GDL - GNU Data Language. GDL is the 
free and open-source drop-in replacement for IDL - Interactive Data 
Language. The 1.0 release, coming out 15 years after Marc Schellens has 
first made GDL public, marks several milestones attesting to the 
maturity of the project. Among these - as compared with versions 
presented at the previous editions of ADASS - there are updates in the 
plotting functionalities, major advancements in the Windows version of 
GDL, rewritten support for IDL save files, multi-threaded performance 
improvements and additions targeting compatibility with newer versions 
of IDL (including new data types).

GDL 1.0 is also the first major release following the move of GDL 
development from SourceForge (thank you for the last 15 years of 
hospitality!) to Github. This relocation was an occasion for a major 
effort targeting developer-workflow-oriented automation which helps us 
reduce entry barriers for new contributions, ensure increasing code 
coverage with automatic tests, facilitate maintenance and user support 
as well as ensure result reproducibility and traceability. Several of 
the lessons learn, insights gained and remaining challenges related 
with the development of the continuous integration process for the 
project will be reported.

Finally, the presentation will summarize current availability of 
packaged versions of GDL, compatibility with popular IDL-written 
astronomy-related software, potential directions for the upcoming 
releases, and the key areas where GDL could benefit from further user 
feedback and new contributions.
