<i>Breathing New Life Into An Old Pipeline: Precision Radial Velocity Spectra of TESS Exoplanet Candidates</i>
<br><br>
The High Resolution Echelle Spectrograph (HIRES) at the W.M. Keck Observatory (WMKO) is one of the most effective Precision Radial Velocity (PRV) machines available to U.S. astronomers, and will play a major role in radial-velocity follow-up observations of the tens of thousands of exoplanets expected to be discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Sky Survey (TESS) mission.  To support this community effort, the California Planet Search (CPS) team (Andrew Howard, PI) has made available a PRV reduction pipeline that will be available to all U.S. astronomers from February 2019 onwards. Operation of the pipeline has strict requirements on the manner in which observations are acquired, and these will be fully documented for users at the telescope.

The pipeline is written in IDL, and was developed over time for internal use by the CPS team in their local processing environment. Development of a modern version of this pipeline in Python is outside the scope of our resources, but it has been updated to support processing in a generic operations environment (e.g. changes to support multiple simultaneous users) We have developed a modern, Python interface to this updated pipeline, which will be accessible as a remote service hosted behind a firewall at the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute (NExScI).  Users will be able to use Python clients to access data for input to the pipeline through the Keck Observatory Archive (KOA). The pipeline which will create calibrated and extracted 1D spectra and publication-ready time series, which can be visualized and analyzed on the client side using tools already available in Python.   The Python client functions interface with the pipeline through a series of server-side web services. Users will have access to a workspace that will store reduced data and will remain active for the lifetime of the project. This design supports both reduction of data from a single night or long-term orbital monitoring campaigns.

The service is on-schedule for deployment in December 2018.

This project is a collaboration between NExScI, WMKO, KOA and CPS.
