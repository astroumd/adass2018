<b>Title:</b> <i>DevOps: the perfect ally for Science Operations for a large and distributed astronomy project.</i>
<br><br>
The Gaia Science Operations Centre (SOC) is an integral part of a large consortium responsible for Gaia data processing.
Serving terabytes of processed data on a daily basis to other Processing Centres across Europe makes unique demands on the processes, procedures, as well as the team itself.
In this talk I will show how we have embraced the DevOps principles to achieve our goals on performance, reliability and teamwork.
