<b>Title:</b> <i>Azimuthal variation of oxygen abundance in galactic stellar discs of the EAGLE simulations</i>
<br><br>
Context: The spatial distribution of oxygen abundance in galactic stellar discs is decisive to understand how efficiently metals that are synthesized in massive stars can be redistribute across the galaxy and this provide information about disc assembly, star formation processes and chemical evolution.

Aims: We study the azimuthal variations of the metallicity gradients (slopes and zero points) and confronted with the gradients obtained by performing azimuthal averages.

Methods: To get dispersions of metallicity gradients in the galactic stellar discs, there is necessary to divide the galactic plane in 6 sub-regions. To these 6 sub-regions the metallicity gradient is obtained, which is important to get the median and standard deviation of the slope and the zero point, this will be the transcendental variables. The data analysis es based on the EAGLE simulations.

Results: We get 3 groups of galaxies, separated by his standard deviation of the slope of the metallicity gradient; those with low, medium and high dispersion. From low to high standard deviation of the slope, the galaxies show a tendence to be more massive, with more number of particles and a higher value of the radius at half mass (all for young stellar populations).

Conclusions: We find that there is a dispersion in the metallicity profiles depending on the direction chose to estimate them. The preliminary analysis of the dispersions suggest that there is a dependen on morphology: well-defined discs have less dispersion. They also have larger sSFR, hence, thery are more actively forming stars. There is no clear correlation with the total stellar mass (including the bulge). Next steps will be focused on improving this analysis and comparing with available observations.
