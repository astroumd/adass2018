<i>Towards a National Center for Optical and Infrared Astronomy: Opportunities and Challenges in Science, Software, and Data</i>
<br><br>
Following guidance from the US National Science Foundation (NSF), the present-day operating programs of the US National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) and the Gemini Observatory are being restructured along with the future operations of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope into a single organization, currently known as the NSFâ€™s National Center for Optical and Infrared Astronomy (NCOA). NCOA will be the focal point for federal investment in open-access ground-based optical and infrared astronomy for the foreseeable future. I will give an overview of NCOA planning and implementation, with a focus on the new opportunities in science delivery, software, and data systems that this new organization will provide.
