<b>Title:</b> <i>Harnessing the power of archival data to increase  scientific output: the JCMT experience.</i>
<br><p>
EAO, operators of the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) recently
reanalysed more than five years of publications using our data,
identifying which of our TAC-approved projects have gone onto be
published, and identifying which types of publication lead to large
numbers of follow-on publications. This has also allowed us to identify
which observations have not been published either by their PIs or by teams using our archive.


We have also examined the data products and interfaces from existing,
highly productive data collections (both those from our own
observatory and from other telescopes), identifying the features that we
believe have helped encourage uptake and.


We are currently engaged in using this information in several ways,
While this includes both 'match-making' between exciting orphaned observations
and investigators, we are also reevaluating our choice of observatory
produced data products and considering additional, simple interfaces
to encourage more use of these products.


This paper will discuss the observatory software, databases and workflow required
to do this work, as well as discussing the findings from our work that
are most relevant when running or planning observatory archives.</p>
