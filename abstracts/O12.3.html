<b>Title:</b> <i>GWCS - A General Approach to  Astronomical World Coordinates</i>
<br><br>
GWCS is a package for managing the World Coordinate System (WCS) of astronomical data.
It takes a general approach to the problem of expressing arbitrary transformations
 by supporting a data model which includes the entire transformation pipeline from input 
coordinates (detector by default) to world coordinates (standard celestial coordinates or physical quantities).
Transformations from the detector to a standard coordinate system are combined in a way which allows for easy 
manipulation of individual components. The framework handles 
discontinuous models (e.g. IFU data) and allows quantities that affect transforms to be treated as input 
coordinates (e.g. spectral order). It provides flexibility by allowing access to intermediate coordinate frames. 
The WCS object is serialized to a file using the language independent 
Advanced Scientific Data Format (ASDF).Alternatively the ASDF object can be encapsulated in a FITS extension.
The package is written in python and is based on astropy. It is easy to extend by 
adding new models and coordinate systems.
