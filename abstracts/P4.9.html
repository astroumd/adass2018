<i>JWST Data Management Subsystem Operations:  Preparing to Receive, Process, and Archive JWST Data</i>
<br><br>
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a cornerstone in NASA's strategic plan, serving as the premier tool for studying the earliest stars and galaxies and for understanding the origins and future of the universe and the galaxies and solar systems within it. The Data Management Subsystem (DMS) is an integral part of the systems JWST needs to achieve these goals, as it serves as the interface between JWST and the astronomers who use it.  We outline the JWST DMS Operations and detail the systems and tools that will be used to ensure that the unprecedented JWST data products are of the highest quality possible and available in the archive as quickly as possible.  We also describe the rehearsals that are taking place, in order to ensure the operations systems, personnel, and procedures are ready well in advance of the spacecraft launch.
