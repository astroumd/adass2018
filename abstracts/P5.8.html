<i>The Dutch contribution to the ESRC</i>
<br><br>
In current-day radio astronomy, large interferometric arrays play an important role. The data rates coming out such instruments makes it a challenge to distribute data to and process data by end-users, especially those who are not closely involved in the telescope array itself. 
With the advent of the SKA, processing on local compute systems is becoming impractical and the allocation of compute resources, as well as the support for users to process their data need to be a common effort. To do this, the processing of the data will be done at local Science Data Centres, the SKA Regional Centres (SRC).  
In our contribution, we present the work that is being done by ASTRON, as a main Dutch partner in the federated European Science Data Centre (ESRC). ASTRON operates two SKA pathfinder instruments (LOFAR and APERTIF), bringing in experience with large-scale processing of current-day telescopes.
