<i>Astrocook: your spectral analysis recipe book, now with a GUI</i>
<br><br>
Astrocook (http://github.com/DAS-OATs/astrocook) is a budding Python package for the analysis of quasar spectra. The project was first presented last year at ADASS and has since grown in scope and perspective with the development of a dedicated graphical user interface to control its multiple recipes for line detection, continuum determination and fitting of the absorption systems. As we will show, the Astrocook GUI is not only a user-friendly tool to access the packages functionalities, but it also provides a framework to solve the automation-vs-customization conundrum of spectral analysis. Through the GUI recipe editor, the users can now design their own workflows, tweak their parameters on test data, and launch them over extended datasets with no need for scripting. Such approach has been proved effective in fields where the human analysis fails (e.g. the assessment of completeness in the detection of the absorption systems) and is meant to set a standard for the next-generation spectrograph data analysis tools.
