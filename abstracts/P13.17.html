<i>Pipeline Processing of Stratospheric Terahertz Observatory (STO-2) Galactic Plane Survey</i>
<br><br>
The Stratospheric Terahertz Observatory is a balloon born experiment which observed 2.5 deg2 of the Galactic Plane in the [CII] 158 micron transition.  We describe the STO-2 data processing and data products as well as the challenges present with these data.
