<i>(2+1) dimensional cosmological models in f(R,T) gravity with Λ(R,T)</i>
<br><br>
We intend to study a new class of cosmological models in f(R, T) modiﬁed theories of gravity, hence deﬁne the cosmological constant Λ as a function of the trace of the stress energy-momentum-tensor T and the Ricci scalar R, and name such a model Λ(R,T) gravity where we have speciﬁed a certain form of Λ(R, T). Λ(R, T) is also deﬁned in the perfect ﬂuid and dust case. Some physical and geometric properties of the model are also discussed. We study behaviour of some cosmological quantities such as Hubble and deceleration parameters and also the redshift function. The model is innovative in the sense that it has been described in terms of both R and T and display a better understanding of the cosmological observations.
