<i>Hit the Ground Running: Data Management for JWST</i>
<br><br>
As the launch of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) approaches a team of engineers and scientist is hard at work developing the Data Management Subsystem (DMS) for JWST with its cadre of complex imaging and spectral instruments.  DMS will perform receipt of science and engineering telemetry data; will perform reformatting, quality checking, calibration, data processing; will archive the data; will have tools for retrieving the data;  will have the capacities for reprocessing the data; will have external/public calibration tools; will provide user notification, search, and access tools for JWST science and engineering data;  will distribute data to the end user; provide extensive user analysis/visualization tools; and, will provide support for contributed data products from the community. We will give an overview of the software components, the hardware they run on, the programming languages/systems used, the complexity of the tested end to end science data flow, the current functionality of the system and what's to come for the JWST Data Management Subsystem in preparation for launch.
