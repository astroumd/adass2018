<i>SCIENCE EXPLOITATION IN A BIG DATA ARCHIVE: THE EUCLID SCIENTIFIC ARCHIVE SYSTEM</i>
<br><br>
Euclid is an ESA mission and a milestone to explore the dark Universe. Euclid will map the 3D distribution of up to two billion galaxies and dark matter associated with them. It will hence measure the large-scale structures of the Universe across 10 billion light years, revealing the history of its expansion and the growth of structures during the last three-quarters of its history. In total Euclid will produce up to 26 PB per year of observations. 

The Euclid Archive System is a joint development between ESA and the Euclid Consortium and is led by the Science Data Centres of the Netherlands and the ESDC (ESA Science Data Centre). The EAS is composed by three different subsystems: Data Processing System (DPS), Distributed Storage System (DSS) and Science Archive System (SAS). The SAS is being built at the ESDC and is intended to provide access to the most valuable scientific data, which is currently estimated in 10 PB of images, catalogue and spectra, after 6 years mission.

Big-data technologies, driven by nature and data volume, are transforming the way of doing scientific research towards collaborative platforms whose first goal is to enable access and process large data sets in ways that could not be done downloading the data. Distributed shared-nothing architectures for databases and data processing allowing scaling-out, joint with interactive analysis tools are currently the main technologies explored as part of the Euclid scientific archive. Some examples are: JupyterLab, Apache Spark, GreenPlum and PostgresXL. 
We will describe how Euclid in the context of the ESDC and in collaboration with the Gaia archive, envisages such a challenge to reach the scientific goals of the mission.
