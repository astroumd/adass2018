<b>Title:</b> <i>Agile meets Requirements</i>
<br><p>
Initially, the Science Ground Segment development for the BepiColombo mission; a joined venture to explore Mercury with two separate spacecraft ESA’s Mercury Planetary Orbiter and JAXA’s Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter; followed a requirements flow-down approach, i.e. a V-model; from the Science Implementation Requirements Document (SIRD) to System to Sub-system requirements, split into Launch and Mercury systems; each system with iterative versions every six months. After two years into the development, it was decided to introduce Agile methodology for the development of the iterative versions.  The decided approach was to have 6 sprints of one month each with a final formal release at the end of the six-sprint period.  This transition required the implementation of user-stories to convey the requirements to the development team; the use of a continuous integration/continuous deployment environment and the automation of several tasks.
This paper describes the drivers for the transition to a Scrum development, its advantages and drawbacks; and the full traceability from the (SIRD) to the validation of the product, through system and subsystem requirements, user-stories and test-cases; to maintain information consistency. We consider this a good example of the applicability and effectiveness of an Agile-Scrum development methodology to a long-life development cycle program.</p>
