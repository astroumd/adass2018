<i>ESASky: A New Window for Solar System Data Exploration</i>
<br><br>
Allowing the solar system community fast and easy access to the astronomical data archives is a long-standing issue. Moreover, the everyday increasing amount of archival data coming from a variety of facilities, both from ground-based telescopes and space missions, leads to the need for single points of entry for exploration purposes. Efforts to tackle this issue are already in place, such as the ‘Solar System Object Image Search by the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre’ (CADC), plus a number of ephemeris services, such as Horizons (NASA-JPL), Miriade (IMCCE) or the Minor Planet & Comet Ephemeris Service (MPC).

Within this context, the ESAC Science Data Centre (ESDC), located at the European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC) has developed ESASky (http://sky.esa.int), a science driven discovery portal to explore the multi-wavelength sky providing a fast and intuitive access to all ESA astronomy archive holdings. Released in May 2016, ESASky is a new web application that sits on top of ESAC hosted archives, with the goal of serving as an interface to all high-level science products generated by ESA astronomy missions. The data spans from radio to x-ray and gamma-ray regimes, with Planck, Herschel, ISO, HST, XMM-Newton and Integral missions. 

We present here the first integration of the search mechanism for solar system objects through ESASky. Based on IMCCE Eproc software for ephemeris precomputation, it allows fast discovery of photometry observations from ESA missions that potentially contain those objects within their Field Of View. In this first integration, the user is able to input a target name and retrieve on-the-fly the results for all the observations from the above-mentioned missions that match the input provided, that is, that contains within the exposure time frame the ephemerides of such objects. 

Finally, we will also discuss current developments and future plans in strong collaboration with some of the main actors in the field.
