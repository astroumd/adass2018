<i>The conceptual design of amateur public observatory software framework</i>
<br><br>
As the great demand of public observatory, the amateur has built lots of observatories. They usually carry out astronomy observation in remote field stations after traveling great distances. It is not only wasting lots of time, but also not safe. As a result, we designed a hardware integration system last year to support remote observation, and the printed circuit board platform is in making.  Based on this platform, we propose a conceptual design of amateur public observatory software framework as the observation control system. It could not only satisfy multiple observation modes' requirement, but also is easy to operate and more intelligent. It will be a huge boost to astronomy education and citizen science.
