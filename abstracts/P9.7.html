<i>An automatic data collection and analysis software for GRB studies and its result</i>
<br><br>
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), transient gamma rays from the sky, are currently the most luminous explosions in the universe. After its discovery in 1973, GRB has attracted more and more attentions due to its special properties, such as high energy, high redshift, and rich multi-band data.
In this work, I mainly work on the research of central engine of GRB with its large collections of GRB multi-band data. I try to constrain the central engine models based on the statistical analysis of large GRB sample. As the first step, I develop Capella, an automatic data collection and statistical analysis code dedicated for GRB studies. We then collect large amounts of GRB data with Capella from all available public data archive. 
One of the outputs of the software is the signature of a newborn Black Hole (BH) from the collapse of a supra-massive millisecond magnetar. We put special focus on the central engine of magnetar. If magnetars are the central engines of some GRBs, then several evolutionary results of magnetars are expected: (1) the immediate collapse into a BH; (2) the collapse of a supra-massive magnetar into a BH after it spins down; and (3) a stable magnetar. From GRB samples, we find two candidates exhibiting evidence of a magnetar central engine at early afterglow and a newborn starving BH at late time. Our results suggest that some magnetars may indeed collapse into a BH, which provides direct support for the magnetar and BH central engine models. Our results suggest that some magnetars may indeed collapse into a BH, which provides direct support for the magnetar and BH central engine models.
