<i>Science Data Pipeline of NICER</i>
<br><br>
NICER (Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR Mission) data flow from the mission aboard ISS, through the science processing pipeline, and to the High Energy Astrophysics Archive.  This poster will describe the different steps in the pipeline, detailing how the data are converted to required formats, the different flows of data, and how the status of the data is tracked throughout the entire cycle.  We use a combination of Python, Perl, and shell scripts, along with a relational database, to move the data through the pipeline.  The HEASOFT software package is used to process the data.  The data are moved to long term storage at the HEASARC, where interested parties may retrieve them for further study.
