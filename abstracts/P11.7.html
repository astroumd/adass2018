<i>DOI in Astronomy</i>
<br><br>
The use of DOI for astronomical data sets is becoming part of good scientific practice. Although a fairly small set of metadata, almost all aspects of findability are covered. The advantage is clearly, that this is no astronomy special but a widely accepted means catering to the quest of interoperability across disciplines, albeit on a basic level. DOI also move the onus of responsibility for proper data sets from the individual scientist to the institutions. Even the IVOA starts to look for ways to incorporate DOI for datasets into their registry and other services.
Still much has to be done: the agreement on curation procedures and what would be
considered as a data set to stam DOI on. At AIP we provide DOI for a range of datasets, and th poster will provide some insight in the curation procedures and decisions about what we consider a data set.
