<b>Title:</b> <i>Subaru Telescope Network 5 or STN5 - The new computer and network system at Subaru Telescope</i>
<br><p>
Subaru Telescope has recently completed the procurement and installation of the 5th contract of the computing environment called Subaru Telescope Network 5 or STN5.  The original commitment to incorporate telescope sub-systems not managed by contract vendor was a high priority with STN5. We were successful with the procurement of sufficient computing resources supporting the Hilo base and the summit facilities, to move analysis machines, virtual machines and instrument control machines called OBCP’s that have been re-developed to virtual machines.  

As in past contracts the core network environment has been migrated to a 10 Gbps Cisco core switch. This guarantees the highest available bandwidth to critical observation systems, such as Gen2, PFS, SCExAO, Hyper Suprime-Cam, and Summit Virtual Environment. This also allows future upgrades of upstream network switches throughout the dome structure supporting instruments.  

The analysis environment and has been enhanced and the virtual machine environment has been increased at both the Hilo base and the summit facilities. The latter allows for organizational VM’s developed by other divisions to be migrated to managed environment.

In 2018, Subaru Telescope Archive System or STARS, which is a part of STN5, has been developing a FITS correction system, at the request of HSC Team, for modification of FITS keywords calculated by post-observation reduction clusters. Example keywords are for seeing and transparency.  Users can download either FITS originals with ASCII corrections or the updated FITS corrected file.

The future goal of STN5 is to allow for Computer & Data Management Division to be relieved of system and network administration during the 1st year of the contract. Gather necessary resources, manpower, and knowledge, to administer the current contract system.</p>
