<i>MIRISim: the JWST-MIRI simulator</i>
<br><br>
MIRISim is the simulator package for the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), created by the MIRI European Consortium. MIRISim is designed to simulate photon propagation through MIRI, and delivers detector images consistent with the expected on-orbit performance. The simulated data have the same uncalibrated data format that will be made available to JWST observers, and include all metadata required for processing with the JWST calibration pipeline (under development by STScI). MIRISim is written in Python 3 and released as part of an Anaconda environment that is publicly available at www.miricle.org. We present an overview of MIRISim together with example simulations.
