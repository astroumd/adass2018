<b>Theme:</b>  Science Platforms: Tools for Data Discovery and Analysis from Different Angles
<br>
<b>Title:</b> <i>Astropy and the Virtual Observatory</i>
<br><p>
The International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) has been defining standards for interoperable astronomical data exchange since 2002.  Many of these standards are being used successfully and extensively by archives and end user tools to enable data discovery and access.  Nevertheless a skepticism persists in parts of the community about the utility and even relevance of these standards, as well as the processes by which they were written.  By contrast, the Astropy Project, with its very different processes (and somewhat different goals), has been widely embraced by the community for the usefulness and usability of its interoperable Python packages.  In this talk I will discuss what these projects might learn from each other, and how more collaboration might benefit both projects and the community in general.</p>
