<i>stginga: Ginga Plugins for Data Analysis and Quality Assurance of HST and JWST Science Data</i>
<br><br>
stginga is an image visualization package to assist in data analysis and quality assurance of science data from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).  It is based on the Ginga toolkit for building scientific viewers. In this poster, we will describe the main plugins developed for data analysis and quality assurance tasks with stginga.  We also discuss the basic outline of writing a Ginga plugin, with pointers to documentation and examples.
