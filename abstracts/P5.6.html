<i>Data Analysis Tools for JWST and Beyond</i>
<br><br>
Data Analysis tools are essential for transforming data into knowledge. They are distinct from pipeline tools in that they usually require interaction and tailoring to specific scientific needs, but parts of the analysis process can often be turned into a pipeline after an initial exploratory phase. Data analysis tools for JWST are being added to the open-source Python+Astropy, either as complete packages or as contributions to new packages. The tools include libraries to manipulate and transport complex geometric transformations (gWCS and ASDF), libraries for image analysis (imexam and photutils) and tools for analyzing spectroscopy (Specviz, MOSviz and Cubeviz).  This talk will provide an overview of the tools, highlighting areas that are ripe for collaboration, and a brief summary of the agile development process.
