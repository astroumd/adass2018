<b>Title:</b> <i>HXMT Archive and Data Process System</i>
<br><br>
Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT) is the first Chinese X-ray Space Observatory. It covered detection limit from 5keV~150keV. HXMT Scientific Data Center (HSDC) , who producing and charging Data Product， is a branch of HXMT Groud Segment。After over one year operation， HSDC has accumulated over 300TB Data, include  about 10TB raw data and 290TB high level production. HSDC also developed a set of software to process, manager, monitor and analyse data production base on Computing cluster and Storage cluster. Next, We will Use more advanced algorithms blossoming in Big-Data field and AI technology. The data processing software set will also be extended to other telescope.
