<b>Title:</b> <i>Hubble in the Cloud: A Prototype of a Science Platform at STScI</i>
<br><br>
The availability of high-quality, highly-usable data analysis tools is of critical importance to all astronomers as is easy access to data from our archives. In this talk I will describe the approach to developing the prototype of a new cloud-based data management environment for astronomical data reduction and analysis at STScI. I will examine the decisions we made, I will demonstrate the prototype and I will discuss what new areas of scientific exploration and discovery are opened by this platform.
