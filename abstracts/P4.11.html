<b>Title:</b> <i>DALiuGE/CASA based processing for the extragalactic HI observations with FAST.</i>
<br><br>
We present a prototype for the spectral-line data reduction pipeline based on  the graph-based execution framework DALiuGE, and the CASA single-dish spectral-line package. The pipeline has been designed for the drift-scan mode of FAST multi-beam telescope targeting extra-galactic HI observations.
