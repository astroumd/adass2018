<i>Machine Learning for Quasar Candidate Selection</i>
<br><br>
With the big data era of astronomy coming, machine learning becomes more popular in various astronomical aspects, for example, classification of celestial objects, physical parameter measurement, rare object detection and so on. Quasar candidate selection belongs to the classification problem. Based on a number of present photometric and spectroscopic sky survey projects, preselecting quasar candidates from galaxies and stars is a hot issue. It is easy to separate quasars and stars from galaxies by morphology while it is difficult to distinguish quasars from stars due to their similar morphology. Nevertheless, researchers have figured out various approaches on quasar candidate selection. We will introduce them in detail.
