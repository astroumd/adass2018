<i>Image reconstruction method for an X-ray telescope with an angular resolution booster</i>
<br><br>
We propose an image reconstruction method for an X-ray telescope with
an angular resolution booster proposed by Y. Maeda et al. at
ISAS/JAXA. The booster consists of double coded masks in front of an
X-ray mirror. In order to have a better sky image from an off-focus
image, a proper image reconstruction process must be applied. The new
image reconstruction method is based on the Bayesian statistics, where
the traditional Richardson-Lucy algorithm is extended with a prior of
sparseness and smoothness. Such a prior is desirable for astronomical
imaging because astronomical objects have variety in shape from point
sources, diffuse sources (supernova remnants, clusters of galaxies,
and pulsar wind nebula) to mixtures of them (point sources in Galactic
planes). As a result, the image resolution would be improved from a
few arcmin to 10 arcsec. The performance of the X-ray telescope is
demonstrated with simulated data: point sources and diffused X-ray
sources such as Cas A and Crab Nebula. Through the demonstration, the
angular resolution booster with the image reconstruction method is
shown to be feasible.
