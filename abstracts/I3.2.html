<b>Theme:</b>  Astrophysical Data Visualization from Line Plots to Augmented and Virtual Reality
<br>
<b>Title:</b> <i>3D Data Visualization in Astrophysics</i>
<br><br>
We present unique methods for rendering astronomical data - 3D galaxy catalogs, planetary maps, data cubes, and simulations.  Using tools and languages including Blender, Python, and Google Spatial Media, a user can render their own science results, allowing for further analysis of their data phase space.  We aim to put these tools and methods in the hands of students and researchers so that they can bring their own data visualizations to life on different computing platforms.
