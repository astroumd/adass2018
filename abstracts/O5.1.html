<i>The NOAO Data Lab: Design, Capabilities and Community Development</i>
<br><br>
We describe the NOAO Data Lab, a new science platform to efficiently
utilize catalog, image and spectral data from large surveys in the era of LSST.
Data Lab provides access (through multiple interfaces) to many current NOAO,
public survey and external datasets to efficiently combine traditional
telescope image/spectral data with external archives, share results and
workflows with collaborators, experiment with analysis toolkits and publish
science-ready results for community use.  The architecture, science use-case
approach to designing the system, its current capabilities and plans for
community-based development of analysis tools and services are presented.
Lessons learned in building and operating a science platform, challenges to
interoperability with emerging platforms, and scalability issues for Big Data
science are also discussed.
