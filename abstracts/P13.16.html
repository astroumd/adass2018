<i>Data Citation</i>
<br><br>
As data citation and data preservation have gained increased prominence in recent years, we feel that it is important to continue the conversation that was started during the DOI BoF at ADASS XXVI and expand its scope. There are a number of issues regarding data citation where a coordinated approach would be advantageous to archive managers, journal publishers, and practicing researchers. These include, but are not limited to:

(1) criteria for persistent preservation and citation of data sets; 
(2) labeling of citable datasets (especially DataCite DOIs); 
(3) metadata conventions for DOIs; 
(4) repositories and platforms for persistent preservation; 
(5) discoverability of preserved data objects; 
(6) granularity of the preserved data(sets).
