<i>The Analysis of Periodic Variation of Sunspot Groups and the X-ray Flare Classes</i>
<br><br>
The present solar cycle 24 has been thought to be unusually quiet in many respects. Both sunspot group numbers and flare numbers show a very low level of occurrence compared to the previous cycles. This study investigated the variations and relationship exhibited between the sunspot group numbers and the solar x-ray flares classes (B, C, M and X) in the solar cycles 23 and 24. The Observations of sunspot groups and the solar x-ray flares are archived in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) website. The study was conducted using the continuous wavelet transforms, and the cross-correlation methods. Firstly, we found that the total daily solar flare produced is asynchronous and in antiphase with the sunspot group numbers while it is positively correlated with the sunspot group numbers on cross-correlation analysis. Periodicities of short and intermediate variations were also observed with sunspot group numbers having a significant periodicity around 400 days. The phase asynchrony between the sunspot group numbers and the total flares which is a result of the drop in B and C flares during solar maximum could be attributed to overwhelming of M and X flares produced by magnetic flux system from the active region/sunspot groups.
