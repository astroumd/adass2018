<i>Acceleration of Non-Linear Minimisation with PyTorch</i>
<br><br>
Minimisation (or, equivalently, maximisation) of non-linear functions
is a widespread tool in astronomy, e.g., maximum likelihood or maximum
a-posteriori estimates of model parameters. Training of machine
learning models can also be expressed as a minimisation problem
(although with some idiosyncrasies). This similarity opens the
possibility of re-purposing machine learning software for general
minimisation problems in science.

I show that PyTorch, a software framework intended primarily for
training of neural networks, can easily be applied to general function
minimisation in science. I demonstrate this with an example inverse
problem, the Out-of-Focus Holography technique for measuring
telescope surfaces, where a improvement in time-to-solution of around
300 times is achieved with respect to a conventional NumPy
implementation. The software engineering effort needed to achieve this
speed is modest, and readability and maintainability are largely
unaffected.
