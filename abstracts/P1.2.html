<i>Deep-Learning Continuous Gravitational Waves</i>
<br><br>
The search for continuous gravitational waves from unknown
spinning neutron stars presents an open computational challenge: optimal
fully-coherent matched filtering is computationally impossible, and
empirical semi-coherent methods are the best current alternative known.
There has been promising progress recently in applying Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks as a detection method for binary
black-hole coalescence signals (George&Huerta, Gabbard et al,
Gebhard et al (2017)).
Here we present results of our study on the feasibility and potential of
using similar networks to search for continuous gravitational waves
directly in the detector strain data.
