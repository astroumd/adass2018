<i>CASA, the Common Astronomy Software Applications for Radio Astronomy</i>
<br><br>
CASA, the Common Astronomy Software Applications package, is the primary data-reduction and -analysis software for the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), and is frequently used also for other radio telescopes. The package can process both interferometric and single dish data, and one of its core functionalities is to support the ALMA and VLA pipelines. The CASA infrastructure consists of a set of C++ tools bundled together under an iPython interface as data reduction and analysis tasks, which are easy to use by the astronomical community. The National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) guides an international team of developers and scientists from various institutions, who maintain and continuously improve the CASA software. This poster will give you an overview of the current status of the CASA software, and upcoming changes that the CASA team plans for the near future.
