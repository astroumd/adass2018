<b>Title:</b> <i>The Murchison Widefield Array's VO compliant archive</i>
<br><p>
The Murchison Widefield Array is a SKA pre-cursor operated on the site of the planned SKA1-LOW. It  has been operational since more than 4 years and during that time it has collected around 25 PB of data. During 2018 we have been working on a separately funded project to implement a completely new access system to the MWA archive, which also includes an on-the-fly calibration pipeline and is based on IVOA standards. As part of the implementation we have also implemented a new VOSpace server system in Python, which has been released as an open source contribution to the community. In this paper we are presenting an overview of the new MWA archive system, including the web interface, authentication/authorisation, data processing, staging and delivery.</p>
