<b>Title:</b> <i>A TripleStore implementation of the IVOA Provenance Data model</i>
<br><br>
The IVOA  has proposed a standard for capturing the provenance metadata in the production and distribution of astronomical data.
We present an implementation in a tripple store for the provenance information recorded for a collection of astronomical images. 
The ontology applied is derived from PROV-O  from the W3C and from the IVOA Provenance data model. SPARQL queries  based on the Data model concepts allow to select datasets based on a wide range of provenance properties and have proven to be efficient in the tripple store representation. The data model of the SIMBAD CDS data base  has also been tested, and has proven to scale very efficiently in the tripplestore strategy as well.
