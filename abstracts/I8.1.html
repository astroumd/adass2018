<i>Data challenges of the VO in Time Domain Astronomy</i>
<br>
Surveys specifically designed to monitor the transient sky have opened the window for discovery and exploration through time domain. Source classification and transmission of the alerts for further follow-up as well as analysing possible periodicity in variable sources poses a challenge with the huge amounts of data synoptic missions are providing. We will review some of the challenges of Time Domain data and we will share some of the tools and services that are being built within the Virtual Observatory to discover, access, visualise and analyse Time Domain data, focusing in particular on Time Series.
