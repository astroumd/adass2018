Title: Galaxy Cataloguing Expert System (GCES): Use Cases
Lead author: María José Márquez
The observational nature of Science, especially relevant in domains such as Astronomy and Astrophysics sets important challenges in the data analysis domain. Nowadays astronomical surveys yield challenging images with crowded populations, overlapping objects, and faint detections. Here we present a Galaxy Cataloguing Expert System (GCES) to better exploit the knowledge that can be extracted from the surveys. This expert system involves the combination of appropriate AI methodologies, i.e. Bayesian inference, Voronoi tessellation and computer vision all this integrated in an automatic and configurable processing pipeline and requiring intense and intelligent computational capabilities. The GCES system addresses a multiple problem, i.e. i) label sources in an astronomical image according to the probability that each one is blended or contaminated with surrounding sources, using Voronoi tessellation and rule-based system; ii) extract photometric measurements of extended objects using contour-based approaches; and iii) carry out a probabilistic cross-match of sources from different images and bands, using all astro-photometric information available. We demonstrate here the use of the GCES in full with the most representative use cases. When the GCES system is used with the COSMOS catalogue, apparent false detections are re-discovered as real sources. This demonstrates the benefits of using artificial intelligence methodologies in the exploitation of Big Data and the consequent knowledge discovery. The paper is structured as follows: section 1 presents an introduction of the multi-axis problem and its context; section 2 describes the expert data processing and analysis pipeline (GCSE) and its specific use for the problem indicated in section 1; finally section 3 presents relevant results obtained from the different use cases with real COSMOS data sets along with a critical assessment.
