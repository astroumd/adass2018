<i>Executable user documentation for in-development software</i>
<br><br>
One key aspect of software development is feedback from users and beta-testers. This community is not always aware of the developments undertaken in the base-code, neither use the tools and practices followed by the developers to deal with issues related with a non-stable software in continuous evolution. The open-source Python package for gamma-ray astronomy, Gammapy, provides its beta-tester user community with versioned reproducible environments and executable documentation, based on Jupyter notebooks and virtual environment  technologies from conda and Docker. We believe this set-up greatly improves the user experience for a software in prototyping phase, as well as communication with the user community. We will present such a setup where code and tutorial are versioned coupled.
