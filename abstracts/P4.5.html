<b>Title:</b> <i>Full Stack Data Science: Using Python to download, clean, analyze and visualize Gaia data</i>
<br><p>
Python has become of the most important programming languages in the software industry and in Astronomy, specially thanks to its popularity in the Data Science field. However, with the explosion of the Big Data movement, the tooling became quite fragmented and one single language turned out to be insufficient: efficient data access has to be done through databases using SQL, all the Hadoop stack is written in Java or Scala, and modern visualization is usually developed in JavaScript. Even if some current solutions, such as PySpark, enable the use of Python for Big Data, the deployment is often complex and the workflow fragile. This complexity is an obstacle for scientists without formal training in Software Engineering and also for the general public, particularly in Astronomy.

In recent times, the Python ecosystem has evolved to catch up with the Big Data world, and new tools have appeared to process, analyze and visualize bigger than RAM datasets. On the one hand, libraries like numba allow Python to scale up by compiling a subset of the language to assembly code, and on the other hand projects like Dask are bringing distributed and out-of-core capabilities to the usual “small data” tools of the Python in Data Science stack, allowing easy reuse of existing codebases and easy scaling to tens to thousands of nodes.

In this talk we will showcase the power of these modern Python packages to perform Full Stack Data Science on the Gaia Data Release 2. We will demonstrate how to easily download Gaia data, how to process big amounts of data on a modest laptop, and how to scale that to a distributed cloud computing cluster to increase performance with minimal cost and code changes. We will also feature special Python libraries for Big Data visualization that avoid common visualization pitfalls. Lastly, we will justify how these tools simplify the access to Astronomical data in general, discuss the limitations of the approach and talk about future developments.</p>
