<i>Improving Exoplanet Detection through Machine Learning in Wavelength and Time Presenter</i>
<br><br>
With improving precission and stability of high-resolution spectrographs for Doppler planet surveys, intrinsic stellar variability has become the key barrier to measuring the masses of temperate, rocky planets orbiting solar-type stars.  Our team is exploring the potential for machine learning to develop improved stellar activity indicators (e.g., Doppler-constrained principle components analysis in the wavelength domain) and to perform inference on spectroscopic time series (e.g., multi-variate Gaussian process regression in temporal domain).  I will report early results of applying this framework to synthetic spectroscopic time series from SOAP 2.0, describe recent progress and future plans.
