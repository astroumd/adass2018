<i>Rectification and wavelength calibration of EMIR spectroscopic data with Python</i>
<br><br>
EMIR, the near-infrared camera and multi-object spectrograph operating in the spectral region from 0.9 to 2.5 microns, has been commissioned at the Nasmyth focus of the Gran Telescopio Canarias. One of the most outstanding capabilities of EMIR is its multi-object spectroscopic mode which, with the help of a robotic reconfigurable slit system, allows to take around 53 spectra simultaneously. This poster describes how important reduction steps, concerning image rectification and wavelength calibration, are performed with the help of PyEmir, the python code developed as part of the contribution of the Universidad Complutense de Madrid in this instrument.
