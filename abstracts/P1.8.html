<b>Title:</b> <i>Design of KNN Star-QSO Classification Algorithm Based on Cloud Computing</i>
<br><br>
KNN classification algorithm is a mature and simple machine learning algorithm, which is widely used in astronomical spectral classification. However, with the increasing sample size, the traditional KNN algorithm can’t meet the requirements of performance. Based on the cloud computing environment of China Virtual Observatory, the KNN algorithm is optimized based on SPARK + HDFS architecture. Through Map/Reduce, the large samples are segmented and distributed on different SPARK computing nodes, and the obvious acceleration effect is achieved. By comparing with the python-ML general algorithm, KNN's computation time can be reduced by nearly 20 times in a large scale samples
