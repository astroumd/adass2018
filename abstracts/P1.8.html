<i>Design of KNN Star-QSO Classification Algorithm Based on Cloud Computing</i>
<br><br>
KNN classification algorithm is a mature and simple machine learning algorithm, which is widely used in astronomical spectral classification. However, with the increasing sample size, the traditional KNN algorithm canâ€™t meet the requirements of performance. Based on the cloud computing environment of China Virtual Observatory, the KNN algorithm is optimized based on SPARK + HDFS architecture. Through Map/Reduce, the large samples are segmented and distributed on different SPARK computing nodes, and the obvious acceleration effect is achieved. By comparing with the python-ML general algorithm, KNN's computation time can be reduced by nearly 20 times in a large scale samples
