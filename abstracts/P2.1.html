<i>Toward common solutions for data access, discovery and interoperability</i>
<br><br>
The ASTERICS project has supported a program of work to make enablethe data from large astronomy infrastructures (ESFRI) and pathfinder projects to become available for discovery and usage by the whole astronomical community, interoperable in the Virtual Observatory framework, and accessible with a set of common tools.  We highlight the successes and lessons learned.
