<i>Insight-HXMT Timing Analysis of New Black Hole Candidate MAXI J1820+070</i>
<br><br>
We present the Insight-HXMT timing analysis of the new black hole candidate MAXI J1820+070 discovered in March 2018.We find that the source  exhibits state transitions from LHS to HIMS and eventually to SIMS.  Low frequency quasi-periodic oscillations(QPO) is found in the hard state and intermediate states and its centroid frequency increase with time while Q and RMS do not show evolution. With the large effective area of Insight-HXMT at high energy band, we are able to present the energy dependence of the QPO amplitude and centroid frequency up to 200 keV which supplies more constraints on the region of QPO.
