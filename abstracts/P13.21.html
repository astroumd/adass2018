<i>QAC: Quick Array Combinations with CASA</i>
<br><br>
A simple python layer in CASA was developed to aid in writing scripts for array (single dish and interferometric) combination. Although initially developed for TP2VIS, running simulations and comparing with other array combination methods, and adding regressions became cumbersome, and QAC was developed. Both ALMA, ngVLA and CARMA simulations are already supported, but extending to more generic array are planned.
