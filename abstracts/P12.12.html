<i>Efficient FFT-based $\mathcal{F}$-statistic implementation for continuous-gravitational-wave searches</i>
<br><br>
We present a highly efficient implementation of the coherent
$\mathcal{F}$-statistic for continuous gravitational waves, which
leverages the power of the FFT for substantial speed improvements
compared to the (``Demodulation'') algorithm used by Einstein@Home
previously.
The basic idea for this goes back to Jaranowski, Krolak, Schutz (1998).
Our implementation features a number of performance and usability
improvements compared to previous implementations, among other things
the ability to chose an arbitrary frequency resolution, internal
enforcement of efficient power-of-two FFTs, and the use of optimal
time-domain (windowed-)sinc-interpolation for barycentering.
This code has been ported to GPUs (using openCL), resulting in further
efficiency gains by 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to the CPU version.
