<i>BaSC - A Bayesian path to improved source finding in radio astronomy</i>
<br><br>
Widely used source detection and characterisation methods in radio interferometry borrow from those developed for optical astronomy. This approach does not account for the fundamental differences in the data, and rely on algorithms such as CLEAN to preprocess interferometric maps in such a way that information may be lost.

We present BaSC (Bayesian Source Characterisation) - a Python library that calculates likelihoods for sources based on visibilities rather than CLEANed maps, and applies Bayesian methods to generate evidence values for different models of the part of the sky being observed. BaSC is extensible, and can for example provide the ability to account for data from other wavelengths in its calculations.

We will discuss the limitations of existing methods in cases such as the confusion of two sources, and demonstrate the performance of BaSC on both simulated and real observations.
