<i>Running the Fermi Science Tools on Windows</i>
<br><br>
The Fermi Science Tools, publicly released software for performing analysis on science data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, have been available and supported on Linux and Mac since launch.  Running the tools on a Windows based host has always required a virtual machine running Linux.  New technologies, such as Docker and the Windows Subsystem for Linux has made it possible to use these tools in a more native like environment.

In this poster we look at three different ways to run the Fermi Science Tools on Windows: via a VM, a Docker container, and using the Windows Subsystem for Linux.  We present the steps necessary to install the tools, any issues or problems that exist, and benchmark the various installations.  While not yet officially supported by the Fermi Science Support Center, these Windows installations are checked by staff when new releases are made.
