<b>Title:</b> <i>CCSDSPy - Convenient Decoding of Binary Spacecraft Telemetry</i>
<br><br>
CCSDS is a low-level packet format used by many NASA and ESA missions for low-level telemetry, and often contains tightly packed bits to reduce downlink requirements. CCSDSPy is a python library to ease decoding of CCSDS data for satellite ground systems. The driving need of this library is to ease the management of difficult to decode telemetry containing fields that are not byte-aligned, odd-length, or otherwise annoying.
