<i>Contracts Tracking for Astronomical Infrastructure Projects in Jira</i>
<br><br>
A custom Jira workflow has been developed at Astronomy Australia Limited (AAL) for contract status management. The Jira cloud-hosted system provides quick determination of contracts' statuses for AAL's program of astronomical infrastructure projects. Passive, overview-style contracts' statuses are available from the standard, browser-accessible Jira dashboard and more detailed information accessible via views. Additionally, a configurable level of active contract status updates are provided via integration of workflow transitions with user-specified watchers.
