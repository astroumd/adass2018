<i>Preparing for JWST: a detailed simulation of a MOS deep field with NIRSpec</i>
<br><br>
JWST/NIRSpec will be the first multi-object spectrograph (MOS) to fly
in space and it will enable the simultaneous measurement of up to 200
spectra over the wavelength range 0.6-5.0 micron, allowing us to study
the rest-frame optical properties of large samples of galaxies out to
z~9, and the rest-frame UV out to z10. This powerful
instrument mode, however, requires careful planning of the
observations and good understanding of the processing steps necessary
to go from the detectors' count-rate images to background subtracted,
calibrated spectra.

To support the community in preparing NIRSpec MOS programs and getting
ready to analyze the data, we present here a set of simulations
closely mimicking the deep spectroscopic observations that will be
performed as part of the JADES survey, a joint effort of the NIRCam
and NIRSpec GTO teams.  The simulations are made possible by the
NIRSpec Instrument Performance Simulator software. This tool consists
of two main components: a Fourier Optics wave propagation module
coupled with a detailed model of the instruments optical geometry and
radiometric response and a detector module reproducing the noise
properties and response of NIRSpec's two H2RG sensors.  The targets
for the simulations were selected from the JWST Extragalactic Mock
Catalog, JAGUAR (Williams et al. 2018).

The simulation data package delivered here include more than 60
count-rate images corresponding to the exposures break-down of the low
and medium resolution part of one of the two NIRSpec deep-field
spectroscopic programs of the JADES survey. The simulated data
consists of three dither pointings, for 4 different instrument
configurations (low and medium resolution over the entire NIRSpec
wavelength range), plus the extracted, background subtracted, spectral
traces for each of the 370 targets and corresponding 2D-rectified
spectra and calibrated 1D spectra, as well as the mock astronomical
data used as the simulation input.
