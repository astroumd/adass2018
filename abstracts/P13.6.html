<b>Title:</b> <i>MegaPipe 2.0: 10000 square degrees of CFHT MegaCam imaging</i>
<br><p>
MegaPipe, the MegaCam data processing pipeline at the CADC, has been
upgraded to version 2.0 and has processed 10000 square degrees of
the sky.  MegaPipe has been operating since 2008. It was originally
intended to increase the usage of archival MegaCam data by calibrating
and stacking the images as they became public. That focus moved to
include processing data from the CFHT Large Programs such as the NGVS,
OSSOS, VESTIGE and CFIS.  MegaPipe 2.0 represents several
improvements. The advent of GAIA means that the astrometric
calibration is considerably more accurate. The public release of
Pan-STARRS allows photometric calibration of images that even if they
were taken under non-photometric conditions, by using the PS1 stars as
in-field standards. Together this means that almost every MegaCam
image can be astrometrically/photometrically calibrated to sufficient
accuracy to allow stacking (30 mas and 0.01 magnitudes
respectively). The other change going to MegaPipe 2.0 is how the
images are stacked. Previously, MegaPipe only stacked images that were
taken on more or less the same part of the sky. This limited the
number of images that could stacked.  MegaPipe 2.0 instead stacks on
set of 10000x10000 pixel tiles, each half a degree square evenly
covering the whole sky. The result that twice much sky area can
stacked.  There are now 10000 square
degrees of imaging in the ugriz bands available for download at:
