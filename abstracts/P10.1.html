<i>ESA Science Archives and ESASky</i>
<br><br>
The ESAC Science Data Centre (ESDC), located at ESAC, Madrid, Spain, hosts all science archives from more than 20 ESA space science missions, and various more are in preparation. 

Data across the full electromagnetic spectrum can be obtained through individual astronomy archives for Gaia, XMM-Newton, Herschel, HST, Planck, ISO, EXOSAT and more recently from Lisa PathFinder as well. Furthermore, ESASky is an open science web application providing full access to the entire sky as observed by all ESA and partners astronomy missions.

The Planetary Science Archive offers a one-stop source for data from all ESA planetary missions (Rosetta, Mars Express, Exomars TGO, Venus Express, Huygens and Giotto). In addition, the heliophysics science archives provide access to data from Soho, Cluster, Ulysses, Proba-2, Double Start and ISS-SolACES.
