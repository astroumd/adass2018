<b>Title:</b> <i>Application of Google Cloud Platform in Astrophysics</i>
<br><br>
The availability of new Cloud Platform offered by Google motivated us to propose nine Proof of Concepts (PoC) aiming to demonstrated and test the capabilities of the platform in the context of scientifically-driven tasks and requirements.
In this poster, we review the status of our initiative by illustrating 3 out of 9 successfully closed PoC that we implemented on Google Cloud Platform.
In particular, we illustrate a cloud architecture for deployment of scientific software as microservice coupling Google Compute Engine with Docker and Pub/Sub to dispatch heavily parallel simulations. We detail also en experiment for HPC based simulation and workflow executions of data reduction pipelines (for the TNG-GIANO-B spectrograph) deployed on GCP. We compare and contrast our experience with on-site facilities comparing advantages and disadvantages both in terms of total cost of ownership and reached performances.
