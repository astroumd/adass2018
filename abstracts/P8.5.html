<b>Title:</b> <i>Evaluating Methods for Flare Detection in GALEX Light Curves</i>
<br><br>
The gPhoton flare catalog (GFCat) project will produce light curves and measurement statistics for thousands of stellar flares serendipitously observed by the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) mission, with energies between log10(27) and log10(32) ergs in two ultraviolet bandpasses. This will require an automated search for flares in millions of light curves with time resolution 1 minute. A variety of methodologies have been used for the detection and measurement of stellar flares, many requiring substantial human intervention, and there is no clear consensus approach. We evaluate the performance of a variety of “autonomous” flare detection and measurement algorithms using injection and recovery testing from simulated GALEX light curves.
