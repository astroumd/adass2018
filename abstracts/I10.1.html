<b>Title:</b> <i>Astronomical archives: Serving up the Universe</i>
<br><br>
This talk first briefly reviews some of the current context of storing and making astronomical data discoverable and available. We then discuss the challenges ahead and look at the future data-landscape when the next generation of large telescopes will be online, at the next frontier in science archives where also the content of the observations will be described, at the role machine-learning can play as well as at some general aspects of the user-experience for astronomers.
