<i>Serving large scale survey data for ASKAP with SIA2 and SODA</i>
<br><br>
The Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope is a survey radio telescope that will produce image cubes of over 1 TB each in size. A key problem is how astronomers will work with these huge files. The CSIRO ASKAP Science Data Archive (CASDA) has taken the approach of allowing astronomers and their scripts to work with parts of the files as well as entire files. Both sub cubes and spectra can be extracted in-place for arbitrary subsets of the cubes. The Server-side Operations for Data Access (SODA) and Simple Image Access v2 (SIA2) virtual observatory protocols provide the foundations of these capabilities. I will review how we implemented these protocols and our planned future work in this area.
