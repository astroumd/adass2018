<i>Analysis of Astronomical Data using VR: the Gaia catalogue in 3D</i>
<br><br>
Since 2016, the ESAC Science Data Centre have been working on a number of Virtual Reality projects to visualise Gaia data in 3D. The Gaia mission is providing unprecedented astrometric measurements of more than 1 billion stars. Using these measurements, we can estimate the distance to these stars and therefore project their 3D positions in the Galaxy. A new application to analyse Gaia DR2 data will be publicly released for Virtual Reality devices during 2018. In this presentation we will give a demo of the latest version of the Oculus Rift application and will show specific use cases to analyse Gaia DR2 data as well as a demonstration on how can Virtual Reality be integrated into a data analysis workflow.
We will also show how can new input techniques such as hand-tracking can bring new levels of freedom in how we interact with data.
