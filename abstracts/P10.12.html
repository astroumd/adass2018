<i>The VLITE Database Pipeline</i>
<br><br>
A post-processing pipeline to adaptively extract and catalog point sources has being developed to enhance the scientific value and accessibility of data products generated by the VLA Low-band Ionosphere and Transient Experiment (VLITE; http://vlite.nrao.edu/) on the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). In contrast to other radio sky surveys, the commensal observing mode of VLITE results in varying depths, sensitivities, and spatial resolutions across the sky based on the configuration of the VLA, location on the sky, and time on source specified by the primary observer for their independent science objectives. Previously developed tools and methods for generating source catalogs and survey statistics proved inadequate for VLITE's diverse and growing set of data. A raw catalog of point sources extracted from VLITE images is created from source fit parameters stored in a queryable database. Point sources are measured using the Python Blob Detector and Source Finder software (PyBDSF; Mohan & Rafferty 2015). Sources in the raw catalog are associated with previous VLITE detections in a resolution- and sensitivity-dependent manner, and cross-matched to other radio sky surveys to aid in the detection of transient and variable sources. Final data products include separate, tiered point source catalogs grouped by sensitivity limit and spatial resolution.
