<b>Title:</b> <i>Automatic Classification of TESS Planet Candidates using Deep Learning</i>
<br><p>
We present results from a NASA Frontier Development Lab (FDL) project to automatically classify exoplanet candidates identified by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques applied with compute resources provided by the Google Cloud Platform. NASA FDL is an applied AI research accelerator aimed at implementing cutting-edge AI technologies to challenges in the space sciences. NASA's TESS mission, launched in April 2018, is conducting an all-sky transit survey to discover thousands of exoplanets around bright stars that are amenable to follow-up observations needed to characterize planet sizes, masses, and even atmospheres. TESS observes sectors of the sky for 27 days, after which the TESS pipeline generates flux time series for each stellar target, identifies any transit-like signatures, and calculates diagnostic metrics for each event. Time is of the utmost importance given the short ground-based observing window following each TESS observing sector. Thus prior to the first TESS science data release, we developed a deep neural network classification system to rapidly identify planet candidates or flag false positives. We generated raw TESS data using a physics-based instrument and sky simulator, Lilith, which models the full range of instrument behavior (e.g., camera optics, readout electronics, spacecraft jigger) and includes realistic instances of stellar astrophysics (e.g., transiting planets, eclipsing binaries, stellar variability). This simulated data was then processed through the TESS pipeline to produce complete archivable data products, which we used as ground-truth data to train our deep neutral net classification system and evaluate its performance characteristics. We also show transfer learning results from a neural network trained on 150,000 Kepler light curves, then fine-tuned on simulated TESS data, and evaluate the domain gap for our model between these two distinct data sources.</p>
