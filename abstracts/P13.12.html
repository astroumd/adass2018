<i>The impact of Virtual Observatory Tools in Astronomy Research  in Nigeria</i>
<br><br>
Astronomy development in Nigeria has, over the years, been hampered by lack of adequate astronomical facilities and access to data due to poor internet connectivity.
In this paper, we discuss how recent introduction of the Virtual Obervatory tools in schools and universities has brought a fast-growing interest in astronomy amongst students as well as boosting the level of astronomy research being carried out in
