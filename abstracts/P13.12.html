<b>Title:</b> <i>Anticipated Data Products from the Europa Imaging System (EIS) on Europa Clipper</i>
<br><p>
EIS consists of wide-angle (WAC) and narrow-angle (NAC) cameras, and each can operate either in pushbroom mode with up to 6 colors (plus clear) or in framing mode in the clear bandpass.  The NAC has a 2-axis gimbal that can point +/- 30 degrees from nadir.  The Europa Clipper mission will include over 40 close flybys of Europa with varying geometries, leading to a variety of image products.  Standard (pipeline) data products will include raw data, calibrated and map-projected products, a suite of mosaics, and Digital Terrain Models (DTMs).   Map-projected products will have up to 7 co-registered images in clear and 6 color bandpasses.  Special challenges include removal of geometric distortions due to spacecraft pointing jitter, photometric normalization,  and stray light corrections to best search for and study potential cryo-volcanic plumes.  Advanced data products will include a global mosaic at 50 m/pixel, global color mosaic at 300 m/pixel, regional mosaics at 10-50 m/pixel, a global map of bolometric hemispheric albedo for thermal studies, geodesy datasets to measure Europa’s orbital libration, limb fits for global shape to constrain ice shell properties, change detection sequences to discover current activity, and co-registered products with other Europa Clipper remote sensing data (UV, near-IR, thermal-IR, radar altimetry and sounding).   Both cameras can acquire stereo images and we will produce DTMs of selected areas, including along each nadir illuminated ground-track with the WAC, to characterize clutter in radar sounding profiles.  The highest-resolution images will be greater than or equal to 0.5 m/pixel scale, sufficient to evaluate candidate landing site for a future landed mission.  Public outreach products will include full-disk color images, stereo anaglyphs, and color and high-resolution flyover movies.</p>
