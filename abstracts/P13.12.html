<b>Title:</b> <i>Anticipated Data Products from the Europa Imaging System (EIS) on Europa Clipper</i>
<br><p>
EIS consists of wide-angle (WAC) and narrow-angle (NAC) cameras, and each can operate either in pushbroom mode with up to 6 colors (plus clear) or in framing mode in the clear bandpass.  The NAC has a 2-axis gimbal that can point +/- 30 degrees from nadir.  The Europa Clipper mission will include over 40 close flybys of Europa with varying geometries, leading to a variety of image products.  Standard (pipeline) data products will include raw data, calibrated and map-projected products, a suite of mosaics, and Digital Terrain Models (DTMs).   Map-projected products will have up to 7 co-registered images in clear and 6 color bandpasses.  Special challenges include removal of geometric distortions due to spacecraft pointing jitter, photometric normalization,  and stray light corrections to best search for and study potential cryo-volcanic plumes.  Advanced data products will include a global mosaic at 50 m/pixel, global color mosaic at 300 m/pixel, regional mosaics at 10-50 m/pixel, a global map of bolometric hemispheric albedo for thermal studies, geodesy datasets to measure Europaâ€™s orbital libration, limb fits for global shape to constrain ice shell properties, change detection sequences to discover current activity, and co-registered products with other Europa Clipper remote sensing data (UV, near-IR, thermal-IR, radar altimetry and sounding).   Both cameras can acquire stereo images and we will produce DTMs of selected areas, including along each nadir illuminated ground-track with the WAC, to characterize clutter in radar sounding profiles.  The highest-resolution images will be greater than or equal to 0.5 m/pixel scale, sufficient to evaluate candidate landing site for a future landed mission.  Public outreach products will include full-disk color images, stereo anaglyphs, and color and high-resolution flyover movies.</p>
