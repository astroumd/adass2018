<i>Searching for Optical Counterparts to Gravitational Wave Events with the Catalina Sky Survey</i>
<br><br>
On 17 August 2017, the era of multi-messenger, gravitational wave astronomy began with the discovery of the optical counterpart to the gravitational wave event GW170817.  In this poster, we outline our software and strategy for discovering optical counterparts to future gravitational wave events using data from the Catalina Sky Survey.
