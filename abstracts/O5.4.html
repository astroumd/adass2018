<i>aflak: Pluggable Visual Programming Environment with Quick Feedback Loop Tuned for Multi-Spectral Astrophysical Observations</i>
<br><br>
In the age of big data and data science, some may think that artificial
intelligence would bring analytical solution to every problem. However, we argue that there is still ample room left for human insight
and exploration thanks to visualization technologies. New discoveries are not made by AI (yet!). This is true in all scientific domains,
including astrophysics. With the improvements of telescopes and
proliferation of sky surveys there is always more data to analyze,
but not so many astronomers. We present aflak, a visualization
environment to open astronomical datasets and analyze them. This
paper’s contribution lies in that we leverage visual programming
techniques to conduct fine-grained, astronomical transformations,
filtering and visual analyses on multi-spectral datasets with the possibility for the astronomers to interactively fine-tune all the interacting
parameters. By visualizing the computed results in real time as the
visual program is designed, aflak puts the astronomer in the loop,
while managing data provenance at the same time.
