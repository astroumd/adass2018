<b>Title:</b> <i>Data-Driven Pixelisation with Voronoi Tessellation</i>
<br><br>
In modern Astrophysics, Voronoi Tessellation is a rarely used as a
pixelisation scheme. While it exists, it is almost exclusively used in
signal enhancements and simulations. In Observational Astronomy, with
Gaia, ZTF, DES etc. data becoming available, LSST and Euclid coming
online in the next decade, this branch of science is becoming more and
more data-driven. HEALPix, HTM and Q3C offer excellent ways to
pixelise the celestial sphere, the implementations completely separate
the background information from the signal. There are excellent use
cases to have them independent from each other, but there are also
cases when this becomes a burden in computation when we have to
process more pixels than necessary or require post-hoc calculations to
group pixels at different resolution levels to form larger segments.
With Voronoi Tessellation, it can generate a one-to-one mapping of
data points to Voronoi cells where anywhere inside the cell is the
closest to the “governing” data point. We illustrate the application
of Voronoi Tessellation in a set of magnitude and proper
motion-limited data how it can simplify the survey properties of the
3pi Steradian Survey from the Pan-STARRS 1, where the footprint area
is imaged by the 60 CCDs at ~10^5 pointings over 3.5 years.
