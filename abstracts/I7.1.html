<i>The Minor Planet Center Data Processing System</i>
<br><br>
The Minor Planet Center (MPC) is the international clearing house for
all ground-based and space-based astrometric and radar observations of
asteroids, comets, trans-Neptunian objects, and outer satellites of the
giant planets. The MPC assigns designations, provides up-to-date
ephemerides, and coordinates follow-up observations for these objects.  
To meet the needs of the community, the MPC currently receives and
processes over two million observations per month and maintains a
catalog of orbits of more than 700K objects.

Although the MPC processes observations of all minor solar system
bodies, its focus is near-Earth objects (NEOs).  All MPC operations
are organized around this central function.  The MPC is required to
warn of NEOs approaching within 6 Earth Radii within the coming 6
months.  Thus, the main components of the MPC's data processing system
enable real-time identification of candidate NEOs, with possible
impact trajectories, within a much larger volume of asteroids and
other solar system objects.  A few such alerts are issued each year,
including that for ZLAF9B2/2018 LA.  In addition, The MPC facilitates
follow up observations and the coordination of observing assets for
efficient recovery searches for NEOs.

We anticipate that the data volumne will increase to a factor of 10 to
100 over the next decade as surveys such as LSST and NEOCam come
online, augmenting the already-large volume from programs such as
Pan-STARRS, the Catalina Sky Survey, NEOWISE, and ZTF.  Thus, we are
in the process of building and testing a new MPC data processing
system.  The goals are to maximize accuracy, data accessibility,
automation, and uptime while minimizing latency and maintaining
dependable archives of all data received.

In this talk I will highlight the challenges faced by the MPC, demonstrate
the key components of our data processing system, and describe a
number of algorithmic advances that support a much more efficient and
reliable system.

The MPC operates at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, part of
the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA), under the
auspices of the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The MPC is
100% funded by NASA as a functional sub-node of the Small Bodies Node
(SBN) of the NASA Planetary Data System at U. Maryland.
