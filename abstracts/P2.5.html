<i>Lessons Learned from the behemoth JWST Data Management effort</i>
<br><br>
As with any large project, there are always lessons to be learned for future endeavors that can be applied and/or considered for similar endeavors.  The development of the Data Management Subsystem (DMS) for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) provides such an opportunity to take advantage of experiences and events that can be applied to other missions. The DMS software and hardware tool set is extensive; it involves more than 100 staff including developers, scientists and systems engineers.  It receives science and engineering telemetry data from the spacecraft, performs quality checking, calibration, data (re-)processing; archives the data; provides user notification, search, and access tools for JWST science and engineering data;  distributes data to the end user; provides extensive user analysis/visualization tools.  We will discuss the evolution of DMS and its interaction within the Science and Operations Center (S&OC) covering keys to our success and also those that did not work out so well.
