<b>Title:</b> <i>Building LOFAR As A Service: Processing Petabytes with just a click</i>
<br><br>
The LOFAR Radio Telescope produces PetaBytes of data each year. Processing such volumes is not possible at clusters provided by academic institutions, and thus needs to be launched and managed at a High Throughput Cluster. With increasing complexity of LOFAR workflows, building and maintaining new scientific workflows on a distributed architecture becomes prohibitively time consuming. To make pipeline development and deployment easy and data processing fast, we integrate cluster middleware and LOFAR software with a leading workflow orchestration software, Airflow. The result is a flexible  application that can launch and manage LOFAR processing. With Airflow, we can easily create a service for LOFAR users to process their data transparently.
