<i>Research on Automatic Recognition of Radio Frequency Interference Based on Deep Learning</i>
<br><br>
Radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation is a key phase in data pipeline of radio telescopes. Classical RFI mitigation methods depend on the RFI physical characteristics, often fail to recognize some complicated patterns or result in misrecognition. We developed a novel approach of RFI recognition and automatic flagging with an improved convolution neural network. The network was constructed based on U-net with much deeper network structure for more complicated patterns and more components to reduce recognition error caused by over-fitting. Compared to the most widely used classical method -- SumThreshold, our method has better performance on both precision and recall rate, it also outperformed the U-net, a traditional deep learning model, and KNN,a typical machine learning model.
