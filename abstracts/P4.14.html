<i>Reprocessing all the XMM-Newton scientific data: a challenge for the Pipeline Processing System</i>
<br><br>
2019 will mark the 20-year anniversary of the XMM-Newton Mission. 
So far, the mission has successfully completed a total of around 14.000 pointing observations, and it is expected to continue for many more years, producing a huge number of high-quality science data products. 

Data processing of those observations is carried out by the XMM-Newton Pipeline Processing System (PPS) and the products are delivered to the XMM-Newton Science Archive (XSA). During the two decades many changes have been implemented in the data processing software, partly following improvements to the calibration of the science instruments. Several re-processing campaigns have been undertaken along the mission in order to have an up-to-date and uniformly processed set of high-level science data products in the archive. A new re-processing exercise is to be carried out, as it has been more than six years since the last re-processing campaign in 2011.

Unlike the daily mission operations where a a limited number of observations have to be processed by PPS, a whole mission re-processing is a real challenge. An individual XMM-Newton Pipeline job (of one observation) can take up to five hours of computer processing time, some of them even longer. To achieve the processing of thousands of observations in a reasonable period of time requires a special preparation including a deep analysis of the computing resources. An extreme optimization of the resources sharing becomes essential in our case.

Besides the optimization of the computing infrastructure usage, a set of software tools had to be developed in order
to cope with the management and monitoring of this enormous number of individual Pipeline jobs.
