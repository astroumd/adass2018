<i>ASVO MWA project: lower technical barrier to access MWA data</i>
<br><br>
The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) is a low-frequency radio telescope operating between 80 and 300 MHz. The MWA project aims to perform large surveys of the entire southern sky hemisphere and acquire deep observations on targeted regions. For the last five years, the MWA has generated more than 20Pb of raw data, but there has been no easy way for the astronomical community to access this data or for MWA researchers to share data among their collaborators. The ASVO MWA project builds on the previous pilot project and aims to address these issues by reducing the technical barriers for the community to discover, download and use both public and proprietary MWA data. Specifically, the ASVO MWA project has four service components: (1) Calibration component, which allows users to apply a system determined calibration solution to their selected  data products using an IVOA compliant UWS based pipeline; (2) Authentication component, which provides users with a single sign-on via EduGAIN by collaborating with Spherical Cow Group (SCG) on their existing Identify Management Project; (3) VOSpace component, which provides  an IVOA compatible VOSpace service and functionality to enable users to interact with their data in an IVOA compatible environment; (4) MWA web development component, which provides a modern web user experience by enhancing  the existing ASVO MWA pilot GUI and system management interfaces. 
The ASVO MWA project will lower the barrier for astronomers to enter the world of big data analysis, processing and computational modelling. Further steps in the development of the ASVO MWA over the next few years will enhance ASVO MWA functionality and act as an early pilot towards the forthcoming SKA regional centre. In this talk, we will present details of the implementation and look-and-feel of the ASVO MWA project.
