<br><br>
TOPCAT, and its command line counterpart STILTS, are powerful tools for working with large source catalogues.  ESA's Gaia mission, most recently with its second data release, is producing source catalogues of unprecedented quality for more than a billion sources.  We present here some examples of how TOPCAT and STILTS can be used for analysis of Gaia data.
