<b>Title:</b> <i>MeerKAT Radio Frequency Interefence characterization using Machine Learning</i>
<br><p>
The Square Kilometer Array (SKA) project is an international effort to build the worlds largest radio telescope, with a square kilometre (one million square metres) of collecting area spread over sites in Southern Africa and Australia. It will be the largest and the most sensitive radio telescope ever built and will observe the sky with unprecedented depth and detail. Science results from the SKA telescope are expected to change our understanding of the Universe.

Detection and mitigation of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) is one of the biggest challenges when analysing the observational data collected from the modern radio telescopes. Due to industrial and technological developments, radio astronomy observations are being
threatened by increasing levels of RFI. Also, an important by−product of the increased collecting area of the these telescopes is their increased sensitivity and as the sensitivity of the these instruments increases, so does the sensitivity to unwanted signals (i.e satellites, mobile cellphones, airplanes, etc). Furthermore the dawn of big data has begun with next generation telescopes such as the SKA that will generate orders of magnitude more data than the current generation. The combination of these issues means that old techniques used to detect and mitigate RFI signals are no longer sufficient. More sophisticated and automated techniques will be required.

My research is focused on finding novel techniques and methods that can provide additional insight into various types and sources of RFI phenomena detected by radio telescopes, specifically via the techniques of machine learning and deep learning. My work aims to characterise and classify RFI signals detected by a brute-force algorithm. I will study and catalogue the different kinds of RFI signals that are detected. Attributes found to be statistically discriminative will be extracted from RFI signals and will be used as feature sets. The attributes extracted will be used to train machine learning algorithms such as Random Forests, Decision Trees and Neural Networks that will classify different types of RFI categories. Thus,
this analysis will help in separating outlier signals into different kinds of RFI or signals of astronomical importance. We will also be able to predict when certain kinds of RFI are likely to occur which will aid in proper scheduling of observations.</p>
