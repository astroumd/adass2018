<i>HEASOFT: A FITS Data Processing and Analysis Software Suite</i>
<br><br>
For over 20 years, HEASOFT has provided an ever-growing suite of utilities for processing and analyzing data in the FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) format, dedicated to missions supported by the HEASARC (High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center) at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, but supplying numerous generic processing and analysis utilities to the scientific community as well.  HEASoft currently contains nearly 4M lines of code in over 1000 individual tasks, supports 15 high energy missions, and is used by thousands of individuals or institutions.  With the number of users and partner missions increasing every year, we continue to focus on portability, modularity, and exploring new modes of distribution.
