<i>An on-site data reduction pipeline for the Goodman Spectrograph</i>
<br><br>
The Goodman Spectroscopic Pipeline (GSP) is reaching some maturity and
behaving in a stable manner. Though its development continues, we have
started a parallel effort to develop a real-time version of the GSP,
which aims at obtaining fully reduced data within seconds after the spectrum
has been obtained at the telescope.  Most of the required structure, algorithms and
processes already exist with the offline version of the GSP. The real-time or online
version differs in its requirements for flow control, calibration files, image combination, reprocessing, observing logging assistance, etc.
Here we present results obtained with the offline version of GSP with various instrument setups, and outline the route for implementation of the real time, online version.
