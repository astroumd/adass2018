<i>Triumphs and Challenges of the Astropy Project: Open Development of a Python Library for Astronomy</i>
<br><br>
The Astropy Project is a community composed of individuals and institutes that are interested in building an open source framework in Python for astronomy.  Using collaborative development tools and following an open development philosophy, the project provides an ecosystem of inter-operable packages.   We describe the project infrastructure designed to facilitate collaboration on the development of open source software and provide an update of the most recent releases.   The project has had a number of successes and challenges while being one of the largest collaboratively developed software package in astronomy.  We discuss the aspects of the project that contributed to its success while also highlighting some of the challenges to the project and future developments.
