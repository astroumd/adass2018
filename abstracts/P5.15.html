<i>data central for Astronomers</i>
<br><br>
Data Central is the AAO's flagship virtual observatory service, providing a central repository for AAT and UK Schmidt observations, survey-team derived data products and documentation. The system brings together catalogues, imaging, spectra and data cubes from dozens of surveys, providing an intuitive interface to query, explore and cross-match data sets of national and international significance. We briefly introduce the current services data central offers to help astronomers familiarize themselves with the system, including: the cutout (access imaging data from some of the world's leading facilities to quickly explore sources of interest and produce publication quality images), query (extends the existing functionality of the TAP server and now makes the catalogues hosted at data central queryable via the web interface), schema (browsing the survey-team generated metadata), documentation and cloud services. Finally we'll present the timeline for future datasets and milestones for Data Central.
