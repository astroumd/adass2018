<b>Title:</b> <i>Multiscale spatial analysis of young stars complex using the dbscan clustering algorithm recursivel</i>
<br><br>
Clustering  and spatial substructures sudies of the distribution of  young stellar objects (YSOs) in star forming regions may be used as a key tracers of (1) their birth  sites and (2) their dynamical evolution with time. This work aims to provide a framework to identify and analyze  the multilevel topological substructures of star forming regions using recursively the dbscan density based clustering algorithm.

Sweeping the full range of local length scale from the scale of the whole region down to the wide pair regime, we apply the dbscan algorithm on young star spatial distribution, to identify the density connected components at each spatial scale with a high level of confidence from random expectations. We constrain the free parameters of the algorithm using correlation functions and nearest neighbor statistics. From that analysis, we derive (1) the density components spectrum defined as the number of detected density components as a function of the local scale and (2) the clusterTree object (dendrogram analogue) associated to the full multilevel topology of the density components.  To quantify the complexity of the star forming region spatial structure, we then further introduce the Strahler order as an indicator of the level and depth of the substructures.
  We use this framework to analyze three different density profile types of star forming region: fractal, Plummer and random distribution  showing that we indeed (1) recover the global density profile from the spatial point distribution analysis and (2) derive characteristic structural signatures for each type of region. These intrinsic characterizations of the topological properties of the star clusters are then used to study the topological structure of Taurus star forming complex.
