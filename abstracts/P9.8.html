<b>Title:</b> <i>CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor web-analysis system</i>
<br><br>
CALET (CALorimetric Electron Telescope) has been installed on the Japanese
Experiment Module Exposed Facility of the International
Space Station (ISS) since August 2015. CALET carries  two observational instruments, the CALorimeter (CAL), whose
main target is  cosmic-rays, and the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM).
CGBM is composed of a single Soft Gamma-ray Monitor (SGM) and two
Hard X-ray Monitors (HXM).  Their energy bands are 100 keV -- 20 MeV (SGM) or 7
keV -- 1 MeV (HXM), and the fields of view are ~one steradian (HXM)
or  the whole sky beside earth (SGM).
The CGBM data are released from DARTS
(http://darts.isas.jaxa/astro/calet) in the standard FITS format soon
after the pipe-line processing.
So that global users can easily analyze  CGBM data without prior knowledge, we   are
developing a user-friendly  CGBM web-tool
(http://darts.isas.jaxa.jp/astro/calet/cgbmweb/LCViewer.html).
Using this tool, users can display light-curves from different
instruments in different energy bands, visualize the location of CALET (ISS) at the
time of  observation, and the fields of view on the sky.
Users can interactively change scales of the light-curves, choose
time-intervals to extract the burst and the background  energy spectra.
These spectral files  can  be downloaded as well as
the instrument responses, so that users can carry out spectral model
fitting analysis using XSPEC.
