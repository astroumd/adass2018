<i>Gaia Photometric Science Alerts Data Flow</i>
<br><br>
Since the Gaia Photometric Science Alerts project started operations in 2014 with the goal of highlighting transient events detected by the Gaia mission, more than 6000 transients have been discovered or their existence confirmed.
Gaia data is transmitted daily from the spacecraft, and received and processed by the Gaia Photometric Science Alerts System at the Institute of Astronomy (Cambridge, UK) to extract the transient events candidates. After data processing and filtering, the candidates are eyeballed using a web application where related information for every alert is displayed to assist in deciding whether the candidate should be announced and made publicly available in different formats and methods to the wider astronomical community. 
For supporting astronomers to improve their interactions with each other, and to prioritise and optimise the follow-up of the alerts, the Gaia Marshall web application provides contextual data to the transients. The Marshall acts as a meeting point to exchange information, and improve classifications.
In this poster we present an outline of the Gaia alerts data flow, from the alert candidates extraction to the follow-up.
