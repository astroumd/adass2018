<i>Creating and managing very large HiPS: the PanSTARRS case</i>
<br><br>
HiPS (Hierarchical Progressive Surveys) is a proven Virtual Observatory standard which enables an efficient way to deliver easily potentially huge images collection and allows for fast visualisation, exploration and science applications. CDS has recently published the HiPS for PanSTARRS g and z-bands images, covering three quarter of the sky at a resolution of 250mas per pixel.
We will describe in our poster the challenges we faced and the lessons learnt in generating and distributing these HiPS made of 47 million FITS tiles, amounting to 10 trillion pixels and more than 20TB per band. In particular, we will detail the methods we developed to optimize the generation, the storage and the transfer of the HiPS.
In addition, a color HiPS, based on the two already available HiPS, has been made available and can be visualised from HiPS clients, like Aladin Desktop or Aladin Lite.
