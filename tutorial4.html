<B>Abstract:</B> In May 2018 STScI announced that ~110TB of Hubbleâ€™s archival
observations are available in cloud storage on Amazon Web Services
(AWS).  This tutorial will provide an introduction to accessing this
dataset and to the AWS cloud computing in general for members of the
astronomical community who have not previously used cloud resources.  We
will demonstrate how to access the Hubble Public Dataset on AWS in order
to carry out a variety of tasks.  Participants will be introduced to the
custom MAST extension of the astroquery Python library (astroquery.mast)
and the AWS client Python library boto3.  We will demonstrate operations
with the data such as retrieving, displaying and running analysis on
single images.  We will then show participants how to scale up their
analysis through serverless computing.  Finally we will showcase some
advanced capabilities such as logging, price estimation.  etc. 
<br>
Level: The tutorial will be geared toward novice AWS users. 
<br>
Prerequisites: Intermediate Python knowledge is strongly recommended. 
<br>
Notice: Free AWS credits will be provided but <B>participants will need a
valid credit card in order to create an AWS account</B> even though no
charges will be incurred during the tutorial.
