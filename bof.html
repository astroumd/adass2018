<B>Title:</B>  Unconference session: I want to talk about...
<br>

<B>Abstract:</B>

Topics for this Unconference Birds of a Feather session will be chosen
from those identified/requested by attendees before the
session. Small-group conversation at round tables will allow
discussion of numerous topics by interested parties; the tables have
signs identifying what people at the tables want to talk about. The
session will open with one slide showing the selected topics and will
close with one-minute reports from each table.

<B>Title:</B>  Data Formats
<br>

<B>Abstract:</B>

What's happening with FITS? What data formats are being used for new
instruments? How can we move the new formats toward widespread
readability? Together, both data producers and data ingesters will
discuss how our solutions can become more compatible.

<B>Title:</B>  Data Citation: from Archives to Science Platforms
<br>

<B>Abstract-1:</B>

As data editors of the AAS Journals we a) see steady growth in authors
using both high-level science and/or multi-purpose generic
repositories for storing archival, publication related data & other
materials, and b) anticipate an increase in policies that
encourage/require authors to make such data persistently available at
publication, and c) notice many hiccups in the workflows for data
archiving with extant tools and d) are interested in how science
platforms and archives plan to support the long term preservation and
citation of data produced by their users.
<br>
We propose a Birds of a Feather session to discuss these issues across
the spectrum of services provided by data archives through the new
science platforms. The specific questions this BoF might discuss
include: how do the various science platforms and data repositories
plan to create persistent, citable objects for data analyzed; how can
data citation via a multi-purpose science platform expose and support
the concept of transitive credit (Katz 2014) to ensure that the
software used on a platform is properly attributed and/or cited; what
are the use cases for data citation -- what things get save by whom
and when -- regardless if that data were produced on a platform or
housed in monolithic space mission database.
<br>
The goal of this BoF is then to surface use cases, share
implementation ideas, and move us towards policies that would better
enable the citation and reuse of the data/software developed as part
of the research process.

<B>Abstract-2:</B>

As data citation and data preservation have gained increased
prominence in recent years, we feel that it is important to continue
the conversation that was started during the DOI BoF at ADASS XXVI and
expand its scope. There are a number of issues regarding data citation
where a coordinated approach would be advantageous to archive
managers, journal publishers, and practicing researchers. These
include, but are not limited to:

<OL>
<LI> criteria for persistent preservation and citation of data sets; 
<LI> labeling of citable datasets (especially DataCite DOIs); 
<LI> metadata conventions for DOIs; 
<LI> repositories and platforms for persistent preservation; 
<LI> discoverability of preserved data objects; 
<LI> granularity of the preserved data(sets).

<B>Title:</B>  How do you get the most out of your teams?
<br>

<B>Abstract:</B>

Astronomical software development is typically done in teams,
especially when associated with large instrument and data archive
projects or projects like AstroPy. There are many kinds of teams,
small, medium or large, single- or multi-institutional, formal or
informal. How well do these teams function? How can we even measure
this? This BoF session will examine different types of teams and ways
that we can make our teams work more effectively. We will lead with
three presentations from different teams, followed by a moderated
group discussion.

<B>Title:</B>   Beginners Guide to Machine Learning in Astronomy
<br>

<B>Abstract:</B>

Machine learning has become a key tool to analyze and process
complexly structured large datasets. This BoF will be different then
the usual BoFs, that aim for discussing a specific topic. Due to the
large request in understanding and learning machine learning
techniques at the last ADASS, this 90 minutes will be used to
introduce basic concepts of machine learning. Based on a few examples,
different machine learning models will be introduced and their
application will be shown. In contrast to a tutorial session, there
will be space for questions and discussions of typical challenges and
problems.
<br>
At the end of the BoF the participants will have a basic understanding
what machine learning is about. To enable the participants to further
learn about machine learning and to allow for a broader overview, a
list of good online-sources will be provided.

<B>Title:</B>   Data analysis challenges for multi-messenger astrophysics
<br>

<B>Abstract:</B>

The recent multi-messenger observations of gravitational-wave and
high-energy neutrino sources together with electromagnetic signatures
have brought completely new ways for observing the Universe. These are
promising a future where advancing physics and astronomy will be
enabled by combining observations and data from all across the
electromagnetic spectrum, gravitational-waves and neutrinos. We
consider the challenges the field is facing in fully utilizing data
for multi-messenger astrophysics. Such data come from heterogeneous
detector networks and standards and their analysis is often
time-critical to guide further observations. In this area, science
capabilities depend on the interplay among observation, theory and
computational/modeling work. Advances in data science and computing
present additional opportunities and considerations in analyzing such
data. We invite all ADASS participants in this Birds of a Feather
session to engage in an informal discussion on the challenges and
opportunities in data analysis for multi-messenger astrophysics.

<B>Title:</B>  Open Source/Development Software Projects and Large Organizations/Missions: Recommendations and Challenges
<br>

<B>Abstract:</B>

Independent open-developed projects have been growing rapidly in
astronomy and related domains - e.g., projects like Astropy, Sunpy, or
Scipy. Large astronomy organizations or missions regularly make use of
the software products of these projects, and at least in some cases,
contribute back. This has the obvious benefit of being able to do more
for the scientific community with less effort per mission.  However,
there are some challenges in this process - inflexible or agressive
deadlines by funded organizations may conflict with the timelines of
open source projects, science vs engineering cultural conflicts may
make contribution more difficult, mismatch between the needs of the
general community and a specific mission, etc.  This BoF session is
aimed at discussing exactly these tensions (or others that are brought
up in the discussion).  The goal is to draft a set of suggestions that
interested parties can take to mission/institution leadership to help
resolve these tensions, or at least be able to enter into them with
eyes open.
