<h5 class="bg-dark text-white">&nbsp;Hackathon</h5>
    <p>
    We will host a Hackathon on Time Domain Astronomy 
    on November 10-11, 2018 in the <a href=https://maps.umd.edu/map/index.html?&feature=building&name=415&basemap=detailed>Physical Sciences Complex at the University of Maryland</a>. This is a community event, drawing people from a wide range of backgrounds, high school, college and professionals, who
    can form teams or work on their own. With help from our domain experts, participants can create their own view of Time Domain Astronomy.
    We will also award 3 cash prizes donated by special sponsors for this event. The winner will be invited to present their
    hack at the start of the <I>Time Domain Astronomy</I> session on Wednesday morning.
    Details about location and registration information are available <a href=https://time-domain-astronomy-6010.devpost.com>here.</a>

    <div id="tutorials">
<h5 class="bg-dark text-white">&nbsp;ADASS Tutorials</h5>
<p>

  ADASS Tutorials are educational sessions conducted as a short class
on a subject of general interest. The main goal of a Tutorial is to
teach skills to participants. Attendance is free for registrants of
the conference and $50 for non-registrants if space available (to be
paid on-site).  Tutorials take place on the afternoon of Sunday,
November 11. It is recommended to bring a laptop, as most tutorials will
post instructions well before ADASS on how to prepare your laptop to
run through the tutorials.
