  There are two categories of oral presentations: invited and contributed. Projection screens at the conference center
  will have a 16:9 ratio, if you want to optimize your presentation. We have HDMI and VGA, we prefer to use the
  conference laptop, but when tested in advance and speakers have a good reason: bring your laptop and dongles.
  The time allocations are as follows:
