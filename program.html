Here is a very rough outline of the IVOA/ADASS week, all times probably accurate to an hour.
All events are in The Hotel, unless otherwise noted. All talks (except BoF and tutorial) are
presented serially. For BoF and tutorial we have two parallel sessions. Some of the IVOA sessions
are in parallel breakout groups.
