<H2> Tutorial 1 </H2>

<B>Instructor:</B> Sebastien Derriere (CDS)
<br>
<B>Title:</B> All-sky astronomy with HiPS and MOCs.
<br>
<B>Time:</B>   TBD
<br>
<B>Instructions:</B>   <A HREF=http://cds.unistra.fr/adass2018/>

<B>Abstract:</B> The main goal of this tutorial is to teach participants how to use
recent Virtual Observatory standards allowing exploration and querying
of all-sky datasets. The Hierarchical Progressive Survey
<A HREF=http://www.ivoa.net/documents/HiPS/>(HiPS)</A>
and the Multi-Order Coverage map
<A HREF=http://www.ivoa.net/documents/MOC/>(MOC)</A>
can be used by data providers to expose their datasets (images or
catalogues), and astronomers can use them to perform complex queries
on all-sky datasets.  Participants will create image and catalogue
HiPS, learn how to compare them to reference datasets, and share them
in a web page. Advanced usage with the Table Access Protocol and
astropy/MOCpy will also be shown.

<H2> Tutorial 2 </H2>

<B>Instructor:</B> Hendrik Heinl (Heidelberg)
<br>
<B>Title:</B> A comprehensive use case scenario of VO standards and protocols
<br>
<B>Time:</B>   TBD
<br>
<B>Instructions:</B>  <A HREF=http://www.g-vo.org/pmwiki/VOWorkshop/VOtutorialADASS2018>

<B>Abstract:</B> Today, IVOA interoperability standards like Simple Cone
Search (SCS), Simple Image Access (SIAP) and TAP/ADQL are used by many
astronomers. Most recent surveys like Gaia are making use of these
standards for publishing their data, future surveys like LSST or SKA
plan to do so. Though accessing data of a single service makes a good
bunch of VO use cases so far, familiarity with VO standards opens the
possibility to combine and crossmatch the data of several surveys and
service within a few steps: knowing how to access one service means
knowing how to access all of them. The following tutorial introduces
into the usage of some of these standards and how one can remotely
crossmatch between different services and survey. As example we chose
the use case of identifying brown dwarves in 2MASS and SDSS.

<H2> Tutorial 3 </H2>

<B>Instructor:</B>  Michael David Young (Indiana U)

<br>
<B>Title:</B>  Creating Astronomical Web Applications From Scratch:  Introduction to modern full-stack MEAN development
<br>
<B>Time:</B>   TBD
<br>
<B>Instructions:</B>   <A HREF=https://github.com/IUSCA/ADASS_tutorial_pre>
                               https://github.com/IUSCA/ADASS_tutorial_pre</A>
<br>
			    
<B>Abstract:</B> Attendees will be given an introduction to the MEAN stack (MongoDB,
Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js) method of web development with a
focus on astronomical applications.  By the end of the session they
will have created from scratch a fully functional web application with
a user interface that is capable of submitting a query to a database
of observational sources and displaying results.  In addition we will
explore how we can adapt MongoDB's integrated support of advanced
geolocation features to do complex positional queries and matching on
the sky.  Attendees should leave with an understanding of the powerful
features that modern web frameworks have to offer and the confidence
that they can rapidly develop and customize web applications suited to
their own particular research or archival needs.

<H2> Tutorial 4 </H2>

<br>
<B>Title:</B> Working with the Hubble Space Telescope Public Data on Amazon Web Services
<br>
<B>Time:</B>   TBD
<br>
<B>Instructions:</B>  
<br>
Participants must create an account on AWS prior to the workshop here:
<A HREF=https://aws.amazon.com/console/>https://aws.amazon.com/console/</A>

Make sure you have the following for the tutorial:

<B>Abstract:</B> In May 2018 STScI announced that ~110TB of Hubbleâ€™s archival
observations are available in cloud storage on Amazon Web Services
(AWS).  This tutorial will provide an introduction to accessing this
dataset and to the AWS cloud computing in general for members of the
astronomical community who have not previously used cloud resources.  We
will demonstrate how to access the Hubble Public Dataset on AWS in order
to carry out a variety of tasks.  Participants will be introduced to the
custom MAST extension of the astroquery Python library (astroquery.mast)
and the AWS client Python library boto3.  We will demonstrate operations
with the data such as retrieving, displaying and running analysis on
single images.  We will then show participants how to scale up their
analysis through serverless computing.  Finally we will showcase some
advanced capabilities such as logging, price estimation.  etc. 
<br>
Level: The tutorial will be geared toward novice AWS users. 
<br>
Prerequisites: Intermediate Python knowledge is strongly recommended. 
<br>
Notice: Free AWS credits will be provided but <B>participants will need a
valid credit card in order to create an AWS account</B> even though no
charges will be incurred during the tutorial.
